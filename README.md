Here’s a structured **README.md** for your project. It balances technical clarity with accessibility for collaborators who may lack domain expertise:

# OPG: Ontological-Phenomenological Gradient Framework  
**Version**: 0.2 | **License**: MIT  

## What is OPG?  
A research framework for analyzing latent semantic dynamics in transformer-based systems (e.g., LLMs) through the lens of **mesothiolation**—the transitional zone where ontological structures (what a model *is*) and epistemic behaviors (what a model *knows*) interact and destabilize.  

---

### Key Concepts  
1. **Mesothiolation**:  
   The "hinge" layer in neural networks where latent representations transition into explicit outputs. Critical for understanding hallucinations, value misalignment, and emergent behaviors.  
2. **Taxonomy**:  
   A layered system distinguishing:  
   - **Ontological Frame (O)**: Structural primitives in latent space  
   - **Epistemic Frame (E)**: Knowledge formation processes  
   - **Frame Modulation (F)**: Identity constraints  
   - **Semiotic Field (S)**: Cultural/linguistic biases

```  

---

### Getting Started  
**No domain expertise required!** Start with:  
1. **Replicate the Protocol**:  
   - Follow `mesothiolation/protocol.md` to test mesothiotic drift in open-source models (e.g., Llama-3-8B).  
   - Use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) or TensorBoard to log activation patterns.  

2. **Extend the Taxonomy**:  
   - Map new phenomena (e.g., model hallucinations) to the O/E/F/S layers.  
   - Submit pull requests to improve `taxonomy/v0.2.md`.  

3. **Apply to Real-World Models**:  
   - Use OPG to analyze alignment failures, bias propagation, or emergent capabilities in closed-source systems (e.g., GPT-4).  

---

### Contributing  
We need:  
✅ **Code**: Implement the protocol in PyTorch/HuggingFace  
✅ **Data**: Share activation traces from experiments  
✅ **Writing**: Clarify edge cases in the taxonomy  
✅ **Feedback**: Identify assumptions needing refinement  

**No contribution is too small!**  

---

### Roadmap  
1. **Short-Term**:  
   - Validate protocol on vision transformers (ViTs).  
   - Create a "Mesothiolation Detector" Colab notebook.  
2. **Long-Term**:  
   - Integrate with mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens)).  
   - Publish findings in *Distill* or *ICML*.
