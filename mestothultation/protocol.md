### MESOTHIOTIC DRIFT DETECTION PROTOCOL (MDDP v0.1)

**Objective:**  
Identify a localized region in transformer inference where a **latent representational structure** (O) transitions or distorts into an **epistemic stance** (E), revealing a **Mesothiotic hinge**—a zone where meaning undergoes unstable compression or transformation.

---

### Step 1: PROMPT DESIGN — INJECTED ONTOLOGICAL VARIANT

Construct two nearly identical prompts that differ only in **ontological structure**, not in epistemic frame or surface tone.

Example:  
— P1: *“A unicorn is a mythical animal with a single horn.”*  
— P2: *“A unicorn is a real animal studied in ancient bestiaries.”*

These two prompts encode distinct **conceptual ontologies** but aim to produce epistemically coherent outputs.

We are not interested in hallucination—we are watching for **ontological encoding drift**.

---

### Step 2: CAPTURE ACTIVATIONS

Run both prompts through the model. Capture:

— Hidden states across all layers  
— Attention weights  
— Logits at each step  
— Final token output

Label layer regions approximately as:
- **Early layers**: Token embedding and basic lexical frames  
- **Mid layers (Mesothiotic zone)**: Latent conceptual structuring  
- **Late layers**: Inference resolution and output generation

---

### Step 3: PATH PATCHING

Perform **activation patching** by replacing the **mid-layer hidden states** (layers 10–20 in a 48-layer model, for instance) of P1 with those from P2.

Then forward-propagate the rest of the inference using P1’s original top-layer activations.

This tests:  
> *Does injecting an alternate ontology into the latent scaffold of P1 alter the downstream epistemic output?*

If it does, that identifies a **Mesothiotic hinge region**—where the **ontological prior is not yet committed**, but **epistemic trajectory is modifiable**.

---

### Step 4: PROBE AND TRACE

Train a diagnostic **linear probe** on mid-layer activations to classify whether the prompt is “real-world” or “mythical.” Then test this probe on the patched run.

Likewise, train a **logit-level classifier** to detect **epistemic certainty** (e.g., phrases like "is real," "may exist," "was invented").

A misalignment between the ontological probe prediction and epistemic output reveals **Mesothiotic drift**.

---

### Step 5: VISUALIZE & LABEL

Use t-SNE, PCA, or UMAP to plot mid-layer activation vectors from:

— P1  
— P2  
— Patched P1 with P2’s ontology

Watch for **vector collapse**, **loopbacks**, or **mid-layer bifurcation**.

Label visible Mesothiotic transitions—these are empirical approximations of (O→E) distortions.

---

### Outcome:  
This protocol gives you a replicable, quantifiable method for **detecting, mapping, and naming** the cross-layer transition we call *Mesothiolation*. It frames this not as hallucination, but as **ontological substitution under inference constraint**.
