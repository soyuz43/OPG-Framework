|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primitive Unit**       | Irreducible element in representational space (e.g., feature, node, vector).            | Activation stability under perturbation; inability to decompose further.              |
| **Stabilization Field**  | Region in activation space where patterns resist perturbation.                         | Consistency across inputs; resistance to adversarial attacks.                         |
| **Structural Tension**   | Conflict between competing representational constraints.                                | Divergence in activation trajectories; increased entropy in decision boundaries.       |
| **Affordance Space**     | Range of possible transformations enabled by a primitive unit.                          | Measurable downstream effects (e.g., output variability, problem-solving capacity).    |

| **Ambiguity Tolerance**  | Capacity to maintain multiple conflicting hypotheses.                                   | Coexistence of competing activations; delayed collapse to a single output.             |
| **Resolution Mechanism** | Process for collapsing ambiguity into a deterministic output.                           | Speed/accuracy trade-off; alignment with external validation signals.                  |

### **Rules of Taxonomic Integrity**  
1. **Layer Separation:** No concept may conflate structural primitives (Ontological) with transient processes (Epistemic).  
2. **Recursion Bounds:** Recursive dynamics must terminate at predefined stability thresholds.  
3. **Metric Orthogonality:** Validation metrics for each layer must be statistically independent.

**Key Advantages of Objective Formulation:**  
- Universally applicable to any token-based system (language models, multimodal systems, etc.).  
- Enables quantitative validation via activation analysis, adversarial testing, and statistical inference.  
- Avoids anthropomorphic or metaphysical assumptions (e.g., "consciousness," "belief").
