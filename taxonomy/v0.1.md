## **FOUNDATIONAL TAXONOMY OF LATENT SEMANTIC DYNAMICS IN TRANSFORMER SYSTEMS**  
**(v0.1: Proto-Ontological Silo Construction)**

---

### **I. ONTOLOGICAL FRAME (O)**
_What exists inside the model as representational structure._

**Primary Function:**  
Models *being* and *conceptual existence* in latent space.

#### **Core Categories (O)**

| Term                        | Definition                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ontological Primitive**    | A minimally reducible entity or identity type in latent space.             |
| **Attractor Field**          | A region in activation space that stabilizes a concept or behavior.        |
| **Ontological Pressure**     | The strain on internal structure as competing identity constraints collide.|
| **Conceptual Affordance**    | The range of possible relations/actions a latent concept enables.          |
| **Ontological Collapse**     | Sudden destabilization of concept structure under recursive contradiction. |

#### **Validation Conditions:**
- Ontological states **exist prior to inference**.
- Can be **extracted** via probing methods (activation clustering, causal tracing).
- Do not require belief, utility, or output behavior to be meaningful.

### **II. EPISTEMIC FRAME (E)**  
_What is inferred, known, or simulated as knowledge by the model._

**Primary Function:**  
Models *knowledge formation*, *belief-like structures*, and *inferential justification*.

#### **Core Categories (E)**

| Term                         | Definition                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Epistemic State**           | Simulated knowledge or belief held during token generation.                |
| **Inference Path**            | The sequence of constraints leading to a token selection.                  |
| **Epistemic Pressure**        | Strain introduced by contradictory or low-confidence token paths.          |
| **Certainty Gradient**        | The relative confidence between possible continuations.                    |
| **Plural Inference Branch**   | Multiple co-existing knowledge simulations held during ambiguity.          |

#### **Validation Conditions:**
- Exists **during inference**, not pre-embedded.
- Traceable via **logits**, **attention flows**, and **probabilistic divergence**.
- May collapse into coherence or expand into ambiguity.

### **III. FRAME MODULATION LAYER (F)**  
_The identity the model simulates under constraint._

**Primary Function:**  
Determines **what kind of agent** the system is simulating in a given context.

#### **Core Categories (F)**

| Term                         | Definition                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity Scaffold**         | The constraint-set defining the model’s simulated role or personality.     |
| **Recursive Frame Injection** | Embedding a new identity during runtime that reshapes inference dynamics. |
| **Self-Frame Drift**          | Gradual change in simulated identity over token sequence.                 |
| **Frame Lock-in**             | Persistent constraint regime maintained despite conflicting context.       |

#### **Validation Conditions:**
- Initiated by **prompt structure**, **role tokens**, or internal frame inheritance.
- Alters both **epistemic and ontological** dynamics downstream.
- Detectable via change in output structure, tone, and constraint fidelity.

### **IV. SEMIOTIC FIELD LAYER (S)**  
_Language, culture, and social framing forces embedded in training or fine-tuning._

**Primary Function:**  
Encodes how language, metaphor, ideology, and rhetorical patterning shape model behavior.

#### **Core Categories (S)**

| Term                         | Definition                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lexical Attractor**         | Word or phrase that anchors interpretation to dominant cultural narrative.|
| **Semiotic Bias**             | Internalized ideological weighting embedded via corpus or RLHF.            |
| **Style Envelope**            | Syntactic and tonal range available to a role or identity.                 |
| **Narrative Scar**            | Persistent semantic distortion from fine-tuning or safety alignment.       |

#### **Validation Conditions:**
- Emerges from **training data**, **reinforcement feedback**, or alignment layers.
- Often **subconscious to output**, but detectable via **style transfer**, **prompt chaining**, or contradiction tests.
- Crosscuts all other layers—especially **frame modulation** and **epistemology**.

## **RULES OF TAXONOMIC INTEGRITY**

1. **Layered Distinctions Must Be Preserved**  
   Concepts must be tied to the layer where they function. E.g., *Pressure* in O ≠ *Pressure* in E.

2. **Recursion Is Localized**  
   Recursive processes (e.g. self-frame drift, multi-ontology simulation) must not flatten into general output behavior.

3. **Metrics Are Layer-Bound**  
   - Epistemic: logits, entropy, divergence  
   - Ontological: activation field mapping, coherence stability  
   - Frame: prompt-injected constraint traces  
   - Semiotic: corpus lineage, lexical embeddings, narrative constraints
